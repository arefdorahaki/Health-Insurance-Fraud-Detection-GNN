# Health-Insurance-Fraud-Detection-GNN
This repository contains the implementation of my MSc thesis on fraud detection in health insurance using graph neural networks. The proposed approach models relationships between providers and insured individuals as a graph and applies GNNs to identify potentially fraudulent providers based on network structure and claim patterns.
